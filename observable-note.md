# Note about Using Observable

Once you've been added to the @oducs-vis Observable Team, you can create private notebooks that you can use for your homework assignments.

To create a new private notebook:

* start at https://observablehq.com/@oducs-vis
* click New
* make sure **Workspace** is set to "ODUCS Vis" and **Visibility** is set to "Only You"
* click Create Notebook

To share with your instructor and GTA (for help or for grading):

* click Share
* in the **Search for a teammate** box, enter `Sandeep945-pixel, weiglemc` so that both Sandeep (GTA) and Dr. Weigle can access it
* choose "Can Edit"
* click Add
* click Save

Note that after the semester, you will be removed from the Team. We'll send an email to remind you and give you time to copy your notebooks elsewhere before that happens (you can transfer ownership to your own account). We would appreciate that you remove mention of CS 625 from the notebooks before making them public.
